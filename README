What's this?
------------

This package allows you to use the USB Audio interfaces from M-Audio/
Midiman with Linux.  It sets up udev rules to load the firmware into the
device.

Supported devices:
- MobilePre
- Ozone
- Sonica
- Transit

The project page is <http://usb-midi-fw.sourceforge.net/>.


Prerequisites
-------------

- Linux 2.6.8 or later.  Earlier kernels have a bug in the USB reset
  code which will prevent the loader from working correctly.
- udev version 057 or later


Installing
----------

1) Run './configure'.

2) Run 'make'.

3) As root, run 'make install'.


Uninstalling
------------

As root, run 'make uninstall'.


Running
-------

The udev rules cause the firmware to be automatically loaded when the
device is connected to the computer.
